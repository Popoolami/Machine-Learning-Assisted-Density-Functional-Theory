# Machine-Learning-Assisted-Density-Functional-Theory
Ab-initio molecular dynamics is quantum-based for technique for running molecular dynamics simulation via density functional theory (DFT). However, DFT is limited to hundreds of atoms within a limited time scale. To increase the time scale of molecular dynamics calculation without jeopardizing the quantum-mechanical accuracy, we attempted to develop a Machine Learning Assisted DFT to speed up DFT calculations. We initiate this process with ab-initio MD with Quantum expresso to get 5000 initial forces and atomic configurations. These serve as training data for MLP Regressor model which then predicts next 5000 configurations. To maintain ab-initio accuracy,
